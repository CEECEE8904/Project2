                  Seeking to impress the Mistress Death, who returned him to
                  life, Thanos has gained control over the Infinity Gauntlet --
                  making him an all-powerful god! With Mephisto as his familiar,
                  Thanos wipes out half of the life in the universe with a snap
                  of his fingers! What will Earth do when half its the heroes
                  are killed?

                  To start the day, Thanos wrote his name across the universe in
                  planets. To finish, he'll stand against the assembled might of
                  Earth's remaining heroes! Plus: When Mistress Death rejects
                  Thanos again, he creates his own perfect mate: Meet Terraxia
                  the Terrible!
